# **OpenSSF Governance Committee**

This committeeâ€™s mission is to support the three governing bodies of the OpenSSF, which includes the Governing Board(GB), Technical Advisory Committee (TAC), and OpenSSF Staff (Staff) in helping them to fulfill their respective responsibilities by ensuring alignment, communication, and constant collaboration among all. Execution of this mission may occur through servicing specific requests from one or more branches in a higher-bandwidth, focused forum to provide recommendations to all bodies.

This OpenSSF Governance Committee Repo serves as a central location for the GB or TAC to open issues they wish the GC to tackle.

The Governance Committee is not focused on inter-personal or personnel issues. For those kinds of concerns, the OpenSSF Code of Conduct may apply. Please review the [Code of Conduct](https://openssf.org/community/code-of-conduct/) and follow its instructions for follow up on relevant concerns.


## 
**Motivation**

The Governance Committee was formed to make recommendations to, raise awareness across, and share information between the GB, TAC, and LF Staff, as this committee deems appropriate. 

## 
**Out of Scope**

This committee is not empowered to make decisions but will vote on its recommendations to be sent to the GB or TAC.

# **OpenSSF Governance Committee**

This committeeâ€™s mission is to support the three governing bodies of the OpenSSF, which includes the Governing Board(GB), Technical Advisory Committee (TAC), and OpenSSF Staff (Staff) in helping them to fulfill their respective responsibilities by ensuring alignment, communication, and constant collaboration among all. Execution of this mission may occur through servicing specific requests from one or more branches in a higher-bandwidth, focused forum to provide recommendations to all bodies.

This OpenSSF Governance Committee Repo serves as a central location for the GB or TAC to open issues they wish the GC to tackle.

## OpenSSF Governance Committee Charter
### Mission and Scope
This committee’s mission is to support the three governing bodies of the OpenSSF, which includes the Governing Board(GB), Technical Advisory Committee (TAC), and OpenSSF Staff (Staff) in helping them to fulfill their respective responsibilities by ensuring alignment, communication, and constant collaboration among all. Execution of this mission may occur through servicing specific requests from one or more branches in a higher-bandwidth, focused forum to provide recommendations to all bodies.  

This committee’s scope is to make recommendations to, raise awareness across, and share information between the GB, TAC, and LF Staff, as this committee deems appropriate. This committee is not empowered to make decisions but will vote on its recommendations.  

The GB Governance Committee will select a single Committee Chair or two Committee Co-Chairs. The time and cadence of the Committee meetings will be agreed upon by the Committee as needed to perform its mission and scope.

The Governance Committee meeting minutes will be made public unless an executive session is deemed necessary by the Committee. Agenda, minutes, and recommendations are visible to all members of GB, TAC, LF staff, with the expectation of confidentiality unless otherwise noted. All communications from the Committee will be sent to the GB, LF staff, and TAC. All Meetings will follow the guidelines of the Linux Foundation’s Antitrust Policy. 

The Governance Committee will be maintained until an agreement between all three branches, the GB, TAC, and LF Staff, determines that the Sub-Committee is no longer necessary. 

### Membership
The OpenSSF Governing Board Governance Committee will comprise members from the OpenSSF Governing Board and Technology Advisory Committee. There will be no more than 9 members. Membership composition will include:
- 7 Governing Board Members
- 2 TAC Members

The selection process of the Governing Board Members will be determined by the Governing Board (via a vote if necessary). The Security Community Representative must be offered a seat. In addition, the Governing Board should select, when possible, at least one General Member Board Representative to be part of the 7 total. 


The selection process of the TAC Members will be determined by the TAC (via a vote if necessary). However one TAC Member out of the 2 must be the TAC Chair (the TAC Chair seat does not count towards the Governing Boards seven seats).

## Participation
Meeting participation is open outside of executive session (as deemed by the Committee Members).
